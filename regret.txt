**Regret**  

I wish I could turn back time. If only I had chosen differently, maybe things wouldn't have ended up this way. The weight of my decisions lingers, pressing down on me with every passing moment. I replay those choices over and over, searching for a way to undo what’s already been done.  

I see now what I was blind to before—the pain I caused, the opportunities I let slip away, the words I should have said but never did. If I could, I would make it right. But all I have now is regret, a silent companion that follows me everywhere.
